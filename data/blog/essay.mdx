## Interlinked I

At first, I was a bit confused about what is this social internship and what to do during this internship for this reason our group decided to have a meeting before the internship began we had our meeting dated May 30th, 2022 and we discussed the social internship and concluded that we will be asking our doubt with our mentor to this social internship. Then on the first day of our internship, we had a meeting with our mentor and he clear our doubts about what to do in this internship. After this, our meeting was with an NGO member we discussed our work and then he gave our first task.

The first job for us was to understand the organization and how our (PEOPLE R) organization works so we went through their website and another document that an NGO member provided while going through this reading changed my perspective about how the NGO works and how much tedious it is to make the document and proof of funds and activities done by the NGO.

After our first task we had again a meeting with the team and discussed NGO and made familiar with the working of NGO after this we had a meeting with the NGO member and he explain about the funding but due to our social internship, we can do anything about the funding we explain to him that we aren't allowed to do anything regarding funding.

So our job was to make a social media poster as the PEOPLE was not good at social media stuff, so we decided to make a poster regarding the NGO our task was divided by our group leader and I was given to make poster while making poster I faced a lot of difficulty regarding choosing colour and vector art then I studied about the colour meaning topic which explains which colour tells what like green, it encourages generosity, kindness & sympathy. After this, I completed my task to make the poster.

## Interlinked II

During the internship in the PEOPLE R organization, our team was mainly focused on children's education and social media stuff. Our team was kept updated on any event that was going on in the organization. We learned a lot about primary education and how to organize the event to make it possible and on social media, we were given the task to make the poster regarding the events and about the organization.

While doing those think we understood a lot of think regarding the NGO and how the NGO works. There we a lot of event happen while our internship in NGO build due to our virtual mode we weren't participated much but a member of NGO kept us updated so that we can make the report of the event and submit the report. Whenever a offline event occurs the member of the NGO send us the media and what went in the media and we have to make the report on the event.

## Interlinked III

After going through this social internship I came to realize that even you don't have any funds to backup the organization you can even help the NGO by other need. So this reason I have told to the people that I know to help the NGO in any way they are able to regarding anything that they think they are capable off. I hope this help the NGOs in long term.

During the internship at PEOPLE R organization, I have made some posters for the organization that have been posted on social media I think those will help the NGO to gather members that are like-minded and will help the organization fulfil the vision i.e. Every child in Karnataka should have access to their basic rights and empowerment and mission i.e. To provide quality education and health care services and to prohibit child labour, child trafficking, child marriage and their abuse. To save every child from malnutrition.
