## Interlinked I

At first, I was a bit confused about what is this social internship and what to do during this internship for this reason our group decided to have a meeting before the internship began we had our meeting dated May 30th, 2022 and we discussed the social internship and concluded that we will be asking our doubt with our mentor to this social internship. Then on the first day of our internship, we had a meeting with our mentor and he clear our doubts about what to do in this internship. After this, our meeting was with an NGO member we discussed our work and then he gave our first task.

The first job for us was to understand the organization and how our (PEOPLE R) organization works so we went through their website and another document that an NGO member provided while going through this reading changed my perspective about how the NGO works and how much tedious it is to make the document and proof of funds and activities done by the NGO.

After our first task we had again a meeting with the team and discussed ngo and made familiar with the working of ngo after this we had a meeting with the ngo member and he explain about the funding but due to our social internship, we can do anything about the funding we explain to him that we aren't allowed to do anything regarding funding.

So our job was to make a social media poster as the PEOPLE was not good at social media stuff, so we decided to make a poster regarding the ngo our task was divided by our group leader and I was given to make poster while making poster I faced a lot of difficulty regarding choosing colour and vector art then I studied about the colour meaning topic which explains which colour tells what like green, it encourages generosity, kindness & sympathy. After this, I completed my task to make the poster.
