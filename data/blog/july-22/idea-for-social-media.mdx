## AGENDA

After a meet with sir, we discussed our ideas with Anand Sir, and so far, here are our ideas.

<h2 align="center">OUR IDEAS FOR SOCIAL MEDIA</h2>

### Create an Instagram account

Social media is the most effective weapon to help spread awareness about our organisation. We thought that creating an Instagram account would help us spread the word of the work done by the People R., and how it would help in engaging with the youth.

We've created some posts, to give a demonstration on how it would post.

### How to continue maintaining the account?

For the next few posts, we will talk about the projects that the organisation is undertaking. We will also add the pictures sent on the group by sir, which talks about the accomplishments, meetings and activities that take place.

We could use the right hashtags, and keep creating good and interesting posters and posts, with facts and information that would keep the people following engaged, and aware of the working of the organisation.

Important to note: Engagement of audience, we would do a little research on how to get engagement for the account.

After a conversation with Anand Sir, we decided that we would connect with the people

### FOR THE OTHER PLATFORMS

1. We will create posters like information about the staff, volunteers, explaining how to help, highlighting a success story, and explaining about the organisation's programmes, cultural connections, delving into the organisation's operations, answering a few questions, offering guest blog posts, sharing all of the organisation's updates, meeting with a donor, working with local celebrities, and so on.

2. We make videos, adding all their recent projects to post on their YouTube channel.

3. We can also create lives, or interviews with the people present there, talking about their stories, and lives.

4. We could conduct interviews and host 'lives' with the workers, students of the area, and the organisation heads, to get an on hands experience of the situation of the area currently.

### AGENDA FOR NEXT WEEK

We will work further on our research on social media, and start posting from the next week after developing our ideas further and start of work soon.

We will also connect with the organisation's social media handler, and work with them, giving them our ideas and thoughts, and coordinate together to spread the word of People R to a larger audience.
