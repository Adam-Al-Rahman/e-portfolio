## TODAY'S AGENDA

The social media team got together to discuss new ideas for the posts and posters they are to create. They will finalise the template tomorrow, and pitch the idea to sir by the end of the week, after which if we get the approval, we will start updating the website, Facebook page, and LinkedIn profiles, as well as create an Instagram account with daily updates and content uploaded.

The marketing team has started their research for the same, and will strategize how to introduce People R, and make the companies aware of their goals and projects.
