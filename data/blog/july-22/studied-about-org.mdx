## Meeting

![June 02, 2022](/static/images/02th-06-2022.png)

## TODAY'S AGENDA

Today, the team thoroughly went through the organisation's website, and strategized our course of action. In order to spread awareness about this organisation on social media platforms, we decided to go through its website as we need to understand the projects that the organisation has worked on, and is currently working on, and put it in a manner in which it reaches all the audience in an appropriate manner.
The social media team will soon filter all the data, and ideate together to produce posters, posts etc, and how to spread the awareness through the social platforms.
The marketing team will use the information and look into the projects undertaken, and strategically plan now to present it to the website and as documents.
Over the weekend, we will work more on this further, and we will present it to sir in a meeting next week.

The team will get in touch with sir and discuss further.

## [TOMORROW'S AGENDA]()

The team will work further on our assigned roles, and plan our agenda for the next week.
