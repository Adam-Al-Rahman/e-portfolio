## TODAY'S AGENDA

The team went through the Organisation’s website, and the projects that have taken place, to get a better understanding of what the organisation aims to achieve.
After our call with Manjunatha Sir yesterday, we came to an understanding that the organisation primarily works in the education sector, and focuses primarily on child right, such as right to education needed by the children of the affected areas, child marriage, prevention of school dropouts, child labour etc. in and around the areas of Davangare.
We also discussed how we can use the information the organisation sends us, and how we use it to spread awareness of the causes and goals of the organisation.
Today the team got together to decide what our plan of action would be.
The team had a meeting to discuss the goals we have to achieve.

### Our duties are split into two

One team, consisting of Diya, Siddhartha, and Pavitra, will be working on how to engage with the public on social media platforms such an Instagram, LinkedIn Facebook, and create posters and posts and other related activities to help create a stronger digital presence for the Organisation.
The second team, consisting of Ayush, Atiq and Divyanshu, will work together to discuss ideas on how to market People to the world, and submit reports and how to introduce People to the rest of the state and the country.

All the team members, with the help of Anand sir, mutually agree that our strongest card is using the power of the Internet to help spread awareness of the Organisation, and that creating a strong presence can help the rest of the nation to help bring attention to the people of the areas suffering, and spread awareness of the grievances and how People R provides them with the necessary aid they need.

## [TOMORROW’S AGENDA](https://atiq-urrehaman.vercel.app/blog/july-22/studied-about-org)

The team will discuss strategies on how to proceed further with what is discussed, and discuss with sir. We will also start working on the objectives as discussed above.
